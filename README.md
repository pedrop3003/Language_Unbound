# Language_Unbound
This is our senior design project
The key principle of our project is to create an efficient and accurate translator that has multiple inputs and can use various languages in our system. We want it to be able to take lip reading inputs and be able to have better confidence levels then 50%. Our system mainly uses google open source api tech for the main speech to text, translation, and text to speech modules which uses the communication between our google api software usage and our code to bridge the information being input into the user module. It uses the high speed of google's software to read the input and get the desired output and language for translation and speech outputs. Our morse code model is fairly simple with the A-Z and 1-10 characters defined for morse code and having detection if improper input is imposed onto the input line. The model for the lip reading recognition will be first training the system with lip shapes outlined then using it to recognize and understand words being spoken by analyzing and comparing them with each other. It will then give an output based on the shapes and learned shapes then give a confidence of the output.
